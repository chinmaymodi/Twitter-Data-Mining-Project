# Twitter Data Mining-Project

Code from my twitter data mining project for data mining tools and techniques course.


It is quite messy, and honestly not a very good data mining example. Nevertheless, the work is solid, and I was able to get a good prediction out of it.


After all, how many political pundits and publications are able to say that they predicted the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Elections correctly ;)
